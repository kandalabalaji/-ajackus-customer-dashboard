# User Management Dashboard

This is a simple, responsive web application built with React.js and TypeScript that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete user details. The application interacts with the JSONPlaceholder REST API for data management.

## Features

- **View Users**: Displays a paginated, sortable, and searchable list of users.
- **Add User**: A form to add a new user to the list.
- **Edit User**: A modal form to update an existing user's details.
- **Delete User**: A button to delete a user with a confirmation prompt.
- **Search & Sort**: Users can search for a specific user and sort the table by ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, or Department.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter popup allowing users to filter by first name, last name, email, and department.
- **Pagination**: Displays users in pages with options for 10, 25, 50, or 100 items per page.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface adapts to different screen sizes with mobile-first approach.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages.
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for user input forms.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **API Interaction**: Fetch API with custom hooks
- **State Management**: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`)
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building
- **Code Quality**: ESLint for code linting

## Assumptions

- **Mock Department**: The JSONPlaceholder `/users` endpoint does not have a "department" field. For the purpose of this task, I have mapped the user's company name to serve as the department field.
- **Mock Backend**: JSONPlaceholder is a mock API. **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** requests will simulate a successful response but **will not actually persist the data** on the server. The application handles this by updating its local state to provide the user with a realistic experience.
- **User ID Generation**: For new users, IDs are generated locally by incrementing the highest existing ID, since the mock API doesn't provide real persistence.

## Setup and Run Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd user-management-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

4. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Preview production build:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Code Evaluation Criteria

- **Effective Naming**: Variable and function names are descriptive (e.g., `handleDeleteUser`, `selectedUser`, `filteredUsers`).
- **DRY Principle**: Logic is encapsulated in reusable components (`UserTable`, `UserForm`, `FilterModal`) and a custom hook (`useUsers`) to avoid repetition.
- **Readable Layout**: Code is consistently formatted with proper indentation and TypeScript interfaces for type safety.
- **Effective Structure**: The project is organized into logical directories (`/components`, `/hooks`, `/pages`, `/types`, `/utils`).
- **File Organization**: Source code is effectively organized into multiple focused files, each handling specific functionality.
- **Data Validation & Exception Handling**: The user form includes comprehensive client-side validation, and API calls are wrapped in `try...catch` blocks with proper error handling.
- **Clean Commit History**: Commits are meaningful and track the progress of the project with clear, descriptive messages.
- **Effective Comments**: Code includes JSDoc comments and inline comments explaining complex logic and business decisions.

## API Integration

The application integrates with JSONPlaceholder API endpoints:

- **GET** `/users` - Fetch all users
- **POST** `/users` - Create a new user (simulated)
- **PUT** `/users/:id` - Update an existing user (simulated)
- **DELETE** `/users/:id` - Delete a user (simulated)

## Key Components

### Custom Hook: `useUsers`
- Manages all user-related state and operations
- Handles API calls with proper error handling
- Provides filtering, searching, sorting, and pagination logic
- Implements data transformation between API and application formats

### UserTable Component
- Displays users in a responsive table format
- Implements sorting with visual indicators
- Handles pagination controls
- Provides action buttons for edit and delete operations

### UserForm Component
- Modal-based form for creating and editing users
- Comprehensive form validation with error display
- Handles both create and update operations
- Responsive design with proper accessibility

### FilterModal Component
- Advanced filtering interface
- Real-time filter application
- Clear all filters functionality
- Maintains filter state across sessions

## Challenges and Future Improvements

### Challenges Faced

- **JSONPlaceholder Limitations**: The primary challenge was working with a mock API that doesn't persist data. This required the application to manage state updates locally to give the user the illusion that the changes were saved.
- **State Management Complexity**: As more features (search, sort, pagination, filtering) were added, managing the derived state (filtered, sorted, paginated users) became more complex. The `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks were crucial for optimizing performance and preventing unnecessary re-calculations.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Ensuring type safety across all components while maintaining flexibility for API data transformation required careful interface design.
- **Responsive Design**: Creating a table that works well on both desktop and mobile devices required thoughtful design decisions and CSS techniques.

### Future Improvements

- **Server-side Pagination & Filtering**: For a larger dataset, the current client-side approach would be inefficient. A more robust solution would involve sending pagination, search, and sort parameters to the API to fetch only the required data.
- **Global State Management**: For a more complex application, using a state management library like Redux Toolkit or Zustand could provide a more scalable way to handle application state.
- **Enhanced UI**: The UI could be improved with additional animations, better loading states, and more sophisticated interaction patterns.
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library would improve code reliability and maintainability.
- **Accessibility**: Further improvements to keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and ARIA labels.
- **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages and locales.
- **Data Export**: Functionality to export user data in various formats (CSV, PDF, etc.).
- **Bulk Operations**: Support for bulk edit and delete operations.
- **Advanced Search**: More sophisticated search capabilities with filters and operators.

## Performance Optimizations

- **Memoization**: Used `useMemo` and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Component Splitting**: Separated concerns into focused, reusable components
- **Efficient State Updates**: Minimized state updates and used functional updates where appropriate
- **Lazy Loading**: Components are structured to support future lazy loading implementation

## Browser Support

The application supports all modern browsers including:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
